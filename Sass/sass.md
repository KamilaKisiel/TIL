### Sass - "Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets"
Sass can extend the CSS language because it is a preprocessor. It takes code written using Sass syntax, and converts it into basic CSS. This allows you to create variables, nest CSS rules into others, and import other Sass files, among other things. The result is more compact, easier to read code.

Sass lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance and other nifty goodies that make writing CSS fun again.

#### Mixin is like a function for CSS.

the definition starts with `@mixin` followed by a custom name. the parameters are optional. if we want to call a mixin we use `@include` directive.
