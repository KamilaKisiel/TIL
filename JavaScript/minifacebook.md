### Minifacebook

##### To create minifacebook we need two sets of data: username details and a form of news feed from your friends

__username:__ 
````
let database = [
    {
        username: "lutek",
        password: "topsecret"
    }
];

let newsFeed = [
    {
        username: "Bolek",
        timeline: "Had a great day digging holes on a side of the road"
    },
    {
        username: "Lolek",
        timeline: "Wonder what stardust is made of"
    },
    {
        username: "Tola",
        timeline: "There is no force on this planet which going to make me going back to school!"
    }
]
