###Sum all the prime numbers up to and including the provided number.

A prime number is defined as a number greater than one and having only two divisors, one and itself. For example, 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by one and two.

The provided number may not be a prime.
```
function sumPrimes(num) {
  var res = 0;

  // Function to get the primes up to max in an array
  function getPrimes(max) {
    var sieve = [];
    var i;
    var j;
    var primes = [];
    for (i = 2; i <= max; ++i) {
      if (!sieve[i]) {
        // i has not been marked -- it is prime
        primes.push(i);
        for (j = i << 1; j <= max; j += i) {
          sieve[j] = true;
        }
      }
    }

    return primes;
  }

  // Add the primes
  var primes = getPrimes(num);
  for (var p = 0; p < primes.length; p++) {
    res += primes[p];
  }

  return res;
}

sumPrimes(10); //17 (2,3,5,7)
```

* Create a function that generates the numbers from 1 to `num` and check if they are prime along the way.
* Declare the variables that will be needed.
* Start with 2, if it has not been marked and added to the sieve array then it is a prime and we add it to the prime array.
* Add the others to the sieve array.
* Return the primes
* Loop through the returned array and add all the elements to then return the final value.
