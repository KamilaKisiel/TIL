### How to find largest number in array
```
function largestOfFour(arr) {
   let results = [];
  for (let n = 0; n < arr.length; n++) {
    let largestNumber = arr[n][0];
    for (let sb = 1; sb < arr[n].length; sb++) {
      if (arr[n][sb] > largestNumber) {
        largestNumber = arr[n][sb];
      }
    }
    results[n] = largestNumber;
  };
  return results;
}

largestOfFour([[4, 5, 1, 3], [13, 27, 18, 26], [32, 35, 37, 39], [1000, 1001, 857, 1]]); // [5, 27, 39, 1001]
```
* Create a variable to store the results as an array.
* Create an outer loop to iterate through the outer array.
* Create a second variable to hold the largest number and initialise it with the first number. This must be outside an inner loop so it wonâ€™t be reassigned until we find a larger number.
* Create said inner loop to work with the sub-arrays.
* Check if the element of the sub array is larger than the currently stored largest number. If so, then update the number in the variable.
* After the inner loop, save the largest number in the corresponding position inside of the results array.
* And finally return said array.
