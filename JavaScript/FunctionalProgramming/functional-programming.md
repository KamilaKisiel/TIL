Functional programming follows a few core principles:


* Functions are independent from the state of the program or global variables. They only depend on the arguments passed into them to make a calculation

* Functions try to limit any changes to the state of the program and avoid changes to the global objects holding data

* Functions have minimal side effects in the program

The functional programming software development approach breaks a program into small, testable parts
`INPUT` -> `PROCESS` -> `OUTPUT`

Functional programming is about:

1) Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change

2) Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output

3) Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled

`Callbacks` are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function. You may have seen them passed to other methods, for example in `filter`, the callback function tells JavaScript the criteria for how to filter an array.

Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value, are called `first class` functions. In JavaScript, all functions are `first class` functions.

The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value are called `higher order` functions.
When the functions are passed in to another function or returned from another function, then those functions which gets passed in or returned can be called a `lambda`

### Pure function
`pure function` does not cause any *side effects*
```
var fixedValue = 4;

function incrementer () {
  return fixedValue + 1
 
}

var newValue = incrementer(); // Should equal 5
console.log(fixedValue); // Should print 4
```
changing or altering in functional programming is called `mutation` and using functional programming helps avoid mutations and side effects.
Another principle of functional programming is to always declare your dependencies *explicitly* so variables or objects should be passed into the function as an argument.

an example of global array that is not modified by the given functions:
```
var bookList = ["The Hound of the Baskervilles", "On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies", "PhilosophiÃ¦ Naturalis Principia Mathematica", "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae"];

function add (bookList, bookName) {
  var newBookList = [...bookList];
   newBookList.push(bookName);
  return newBookList
}

function remove (bookList, bookName) {
  var newBookList = [...bookList];
  if (newBookList.indexOf(bookName) >= 0) {
    
    newBookList.splice(newBookList.indexOf(bookName), 1);
    return newBookList
    }
}

var newBookList = add(bookList, 'A Brief History of Time');
var newerBookList = remove(bookList, 'On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies');
var newestBookList = remove(add(bookList, 'A Brief History of Time'), 'On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies');

console.log(bookList);
```
more elegant solution:
```
function add (list,bookName) {
  return [...list, bookName];
}

function remove (list,bookName) {
  if (list.indexOf(bookName) >= 0) {
    return list.filter((item) => item !== bookName);
    }
}
```
