## whats so cool about ReactJS?

1) Components are reusable
code written in as a small, self-sufficient portions can be used in many places which is very efficient and it is also very easy to maintain

2) One way data flow
if something changes in a component it will affect only children components and ancestors won't be aware of that - it creates nice, bugfree code
