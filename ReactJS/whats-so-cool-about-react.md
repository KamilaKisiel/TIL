## what's React
React, popularized by Facebook, is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used to create components, handle state and props, utilize event listeners and certain life cycle methods to update data as it changes.

React combines HTML with JavaScript functionality to create its own markup language, JSX. 

### whats so cool about ReactJS?

1) Components are reusable
code written as a small, self-sufficient portions can be used(rewritten) in many places which is very efficient and it is also very easy to maintain

2) One way data flow
if something changes in a component it will affect only children components and ancestors won't be aware of that - it creates nice, bugfree code

3) Virtual DOM
it is in-memory represantation of Real DOM
this is plain JS object which is copy of a real DOM and that describes the current state of our website and React using this object applies changes into the Real DOM in the most optimum way possible 

4) React ecosystem
React works with many tools and has a big community who serves with their knowledge at any time
