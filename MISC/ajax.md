ajax(Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) - alows to read from server after the page has loaded and update the page without reloading it; send data in the background while user is inteacting with the website

to download data from server we use `fetch` method
```
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
    .then(response => {
        console.log(response);
    })
```
fetch is a part of window object
fetch returns `promise` which says "i'm making a request somewhere in the internet and i'm going to let you know when the value returns". to access the value we use `.then` method which gives us response:
```
Response {type: "cors", url: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users", redirected: false, status: 200, ok: true, â€¦}
body:(...)
bodyUsed:false
headers:Headers {}
ok:true
redirected:false
status:200
statusText:""
type:"cors"
url:"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users"
__proto__:Response
